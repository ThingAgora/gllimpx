gllimpx is a Gl-Less IMPlementation of X3d. Or a Gl-less Implementation of a Minimal Part of X3d.

Or a goofy acronym for a Javascript library that draws a wireframe view x3d model on the HTML5 canvas,
so that a user can catch a **glimpse** of a x3d model online, without an actual x3d renderer program.
